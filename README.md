The popularity of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017 due to several consecutive months of exponential growth of their market capitalization. The prices peaked at more than $800 billion in January 2018.

Although machine learning has been successful in predicting stock market prices through a host of different time series models, its application in predicting cryptocurrency prices has been quite restrictive. The reason behind this is obvious as prices of cryptocurrencies depend on a lot of factors like technological progress, internal competition, pressure on the markets to deliver, economic problems, security issues, political factor etc. Their high volatility leads to the great potential of high profit if intelligent inventing strategies are taken. Unfortunately, due to their lack of indexes, cryptocurrencies are relatively unpredictable compared to traditional financial predictions like stock market prediction.
